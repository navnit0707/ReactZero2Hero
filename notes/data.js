        question: "1. Difference between a Library and Framework?",
        answer: `<p>Ans :<p> A library and a framework are both collections of pre-written code that can be used to perform common
        tasks, but they are different in the way they are used and how they structure your code.
</p>
<p> A library is a collection of functions that you can call from your own code. A library does not dictate the
structure of your code or how you should organize your application. It is a way to reuse code that you can
integrate into your own projects, to make your development process faster. For example jQuery, Lodash, and
moment.js are popular JavaScript libraries.
</p>
      <p>A framework, on the other hand, is a set of conventions and pre-written code that dictate the structure of
        your application and the flow of control. A framework provides a set of rules that you must follow in order
        to use it, and it takes control of the flow of your application. The framework calls your code, instead of
        you calling the framework. For example React, Angular, Vue.js are popular JavaScript frameworks.
</p> 
        <p>A good way to think about it is that a library is a tool that you can use to do something, and a framework
            is a set of tools that you use to structure your project.
</p>
        <p> It is worth noting that the distinction between libraries and frameworks can be blurry at times. Some
            libraries have an optional set of conventions and best practices, which when followed provide a similar
            structure to a framework.</p></p>
