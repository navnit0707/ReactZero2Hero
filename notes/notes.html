    <button class="collapsible"><p>1. Difference between a Library and Framework?</p></button>
<div class="content">
        <p>Ans :<p> A library and a framework are both collections of pre-written code that can be used to perform common
            tasks, but they are different in the way they are used and how they structure your code.
</p>
<p> A library is a collection of functions that you can call from your own code. A library does not dictate the
    structure of your code or how you should organize your application. It is a way to reuse code that you can
    integrate into your own projects, to make your development process faster. For example jQuery, Lodash, and
    moment.js are popular JavaScript libraries.
</p>
          <p>A framework, on the other hand, is a set of conventions and pre-written code that dictate the structure of
            your application and the flow of control. A framework provides a set of rules that you must follow in order
            to use it, and it takes control of the flow of your application. The framework calls your code, instead of
            you calling the framework. For example React, Angular, Vue.js are popular JavaScript frameworks.
</p> 
            <p>A good way to think about it is that a library is a tool that you can use to do something, and a framework
                is a set of tools that you use to structure your project.
    </p>
            <p> It is worth noting that the distinction between libraries and frameworks can be blurry at times. Some
                libraries have an optional set of conventions and best practices, which when followed provide a similar
                structure to a framework.</p></p>
